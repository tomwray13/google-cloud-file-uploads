# GraphQL TypeScript API Starter

This is a starter repo for GraphQL TypeScript backends. If you want to learn how this starter was built from scratch, take a look at the [accompanying detailed blog post](https://tomray.dev/setup-and-deploy-graphql-server).

This starter uses the following stack:

- Express
- Apollo Server
- Prisma
- Docker
- TypeScript
- Postgres
- Heroku

## Initial set up

You can either press the Green Button **Use this template** in the top right in Github, or you can use `git clone`:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/tomwray13/graphql-typescript-api-starter.git <YOUR_DIRECTORY_NAME>
```

Then push your code to your own Github repository:

```shell
git remote rename origin upstream
git remote add origin <URL_TO_GITHUB_REPO>
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

Once you have your own repository set up, install the local package dependencies:

```shell
npm install
```

You can now run your server locally and open up the playground:

```shell
npm run dev
```

See the full list of scripts in the `package.json` file.

## Local database set up

Copy the `env.example` file to create your own `env` file:

```shell
cp env.example .env
```

You can (optionally) tweak the user and password in the `env` file for the local database, but make sure you make the same edits in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

Run this command to launch your Docker local Postgres server:

```shell
docker-compose up -d
```

If you're using the Docker extension in VSCode, you can use this instead of running the previous command in the terminal.

## Using Prisma

To enable querying and mutations to the database with Prisma, you'll first need to add models in the `prisma.schema` file. For example:

```graphql
datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}

generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
}

model Board {
  id          Int       @id @default(autoincrement())
  createdAt   DateTime  @default(now())
  updatedAt   DateTime  @updatedAt
  title       String
  description String?
  path        String    @unique
}
```

Anytime you make changes to the `prisma.schema` file, you'll need to run migrations so the changes are applied to your local database.

There is a script you can use for this:

```shell
npm run migrate
```

This will prompt you to give a name for the migration.

### NOTE:

When running `npm run migrate`, if you see the error

```
Error: P1000: Authentication failed against database server at `localhost`, the provided database credentials for `test-user` are not valid.
```

check if you are already running a Postgres server instance on your machine with the default port also given in this tutorial (5432). If so, you will need to stop the machine instance of Postgres for the credentials to successfully work.

To access the data in the database, you'll need to make use of Prisma Client.

You just need to uncomment this line in the `index.ts` file:

```ts
// import { prisma } from "./prisma/client";
```

And then use Prisma in your resolvers to access the database. For example:


```ts
...

const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    boards: () => {
      return prisma.board.findMany()
    },
    board: (parent, args: any) => {
      return prisma.board.findUnique({
        where: {
          id: Number(args.id)
        }
      })
    },
  },
};

...
```

## Deplyment to Heroku

Login to Heroku and create a new project. and connect your Github repository to the Heroku project, enabling automatic deploys.

Go to the **Resources** tab, search for "Heroku Postgres" and enable the "Hobby Dev" plan.

Then go to the **Settings** tab and add an ENV variable in the Config Vars section called `NPM_CONFIG_PRODUCTION=false`.

Finally, go back to the **Deploy** tab and press the Deploy Branch button.

More detailed step-by-step help is detailed in [the blog post](https://tomray.dev/setup-and-deploy-graphql-server).
